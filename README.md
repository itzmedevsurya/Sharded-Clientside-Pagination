# Angular Grouped Input Pagination

This project demonstrates how to create an Angular component with rows of inputs grouped by a group name. The component includes pagination based on the number of rows and displays them in a grouped view with the group name shown above each group of input rows. The data is stored in IndexedDB using a sharded approach for efficient data management.
